When the program loads, it reads data from LibraryFile.txt.
(Test data is already recorded in the file)

The program has 10 commands:

Add Book (adds a book to the library)
Add Borrower (adds a borrower)
Borrow Book (marks a book as borrowed)
Return Book (marks a book as not borrowed)
List Books (returns a list of books)
List Borrowers (returns a list of borrowers)
Find Books by Title (searches for a book by title)
Find Books by Author (searches for a book by author)
Clear Library (cleans the file and deletes all data)
Exit (saves the entered data to the file and ends the program)


The program takes into account all possible scenarios.
For example, if a book is already borrowed, it will not allow you to borrow it again.
